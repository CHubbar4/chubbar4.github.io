        <section>
          <p style="color:darkslategrey">The purpose of making an website for my resume was three-fold. First and foremost, I wanted to prove my ability for quick learning. I have never created a website from scratch like this before, and I found that a lot of cyber security jobs prefer and benefit from a knowledge of HTML and how it works. So this is my first HTML project. Second, I wanted to show my ability to follow directions. The course, or directions, I followed came from the Youtube video linked below. Lastly, I wanted to show my creative problem solving. My biggest shortcoming in this opportunity is that I don't have enough professional experience. That being said, I hoped that this would show that, even without professional experience, I will absolutely be an asset to Trapp Technology. I will work diligently, efficiently, and effectively to make sure that my job is done to the best of my ability. For these reasons, and my current enrollment towards getting a bachelor's degree in software engineering, I know that hiring me would be a great investment.
